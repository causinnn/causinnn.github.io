                Hello! I'm Seigfred Joshua Causin and I'm a 3rd year transfer from Sacramento studying digital media arts at San Jose State University. 
                <br>
                <h1 id="title_name"><a class="nav_item">Artist Statement</h1>

                    <img src="assets/images/profpic.jpg" alt="Image description" width="321" height="499" style="margin-right: 10px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">Expressing myself through art has been a core aspect throughout my life ever since I was a child, and being able to take my creativity and vision into a modern digital format allowed me to push my boundaries in artistic expression in different mediums and formats. Adopting digital creative techniques and softwares have allowed me to adapt the inner creative drive within me into a fresh and modern format which possesses a greater level of accessibility for audiences around the world. From photography, to virtual reality, to website interface designing and as well as many more, studying within digital media arts allows me to be versed and capable across a dynamic and creative landscape.  Between my time learning at Sacramento City College to transferring and now being in my second semester at San Jose State University, I've enjoyed my time working through a variety of different Adobe Suite programs, as well as gained new experience and familiarity with coding language that pertains to digital artists such as CSS and HTML. 
                      I seek to continue to push my boundaries by adopting new and different digital creative programs and software, as well as work to improve the skills in the programs which I've learned and preferred over others. Studying within digital media arts has allowed me to apply my artistic and creative skills across different mediums in order to emphasize my own unique style while not being limited to a single format of art. Through working with different Adobe programs such as Premiere, Photoshop, and Animate, Iâ€™ve become able to develop an entertaining style of video and photo editing that captures the messages I want to convey to my audience. Digital illustration programs such as TiltBrush, Procreate, and Clip Studio Paint have allowed me to create digital pictorial artworks that I can integrate digital mixed media elements to create dynamic and active artworks. By learning to become familiar with the large variety of formats and mediums that exist within the digital art space, I can take my range of experience into a multitude of different specific fields in the future. I hope my art can reach others through the accessible and diverse world that is digital content and media.
